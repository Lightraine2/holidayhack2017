Holiday Hack - level 2 (unvonceivable, the cliffs of winsanity)
Sparkle Redberry 
"Help me kill the troublesome process gone awry"

well that was bloody easy,

Hint 6


That business with Equal-Facts Inc was really unfortunate. I understand there are a lot of different exploits available for those vulnerable systems. Fortunately, Alabaster said he tested for CVE-2017-5638 and it was NOT vulnerable. Hope he checked the others too


The hints have some pretty useful info! Use these when back on it.
